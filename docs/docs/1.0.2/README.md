Here you will find all you need to know about the product. While Kuma is ideal for Service Mesh and Microservices, you will soon realize that it can be used to implement modern service connectivity across any architecture.

The core maintainer of Kuma is **Kong**, the maker of the popular open-source Kong Gateway 🦍.
