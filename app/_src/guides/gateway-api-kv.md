{% assign kuma-system = site.mesh_namespace | default: "kuma-system" %}
{% assign kuma-control-plane = kuma | append: "-control-plane" %}

To get traffic from outside your mesh inside it (North/South) with {{site.mesh_product_name}} you can use a builtin gateway.

In the [quickstart](/docs/{{ page.release }}/quickstart/kubernetes-demo/), traffic was only able to get in the mesh by port-forwarding to an instance of an app inside the mesh.
In production, you typically set up a gateway to receive traffic external to the mesh.
In this guide you will add [a built-in gateway](/docs/{{ page.release }}/using-mesh/managing-ingress-traffic/builtin/) in front of the demo-app service and expose it publicly.
We will deploy and configure Gateway using [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).

{% endmermaid %}

## Prerequisites

- Completed [quickstart](/docs/{{ page.release }}/quickstart/kubernetes-demo/) to set up a zone control plane with demo application

{% tip %}
If you are already familiar with quickstart you can set up required environment by running:

```sh
helm upgrade \
  --install \
  --create-namespace \
  --namespace {{ site.mesh_namespace }} \{% if version == "preview" %}
  --version {{ page.version }} \{% endif %}
  {{ site.mesh_helm_install_name }} {{ site.mesh_helm_repo }}
kubectl wait -n {{ kuma-system }} --for=condition=ready pod --selector=app={{ kuma-control-plane }} --timeout=90s
kubectl apply -f kuma-demo://k8s/001-with-mtls.yaml
```
{% endtip %}

## Install Gateway API CRDs

To install Gateway API please refer to [official installation instruction](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/guides/#install-standard-channel).

You also need to manually install {{site.mesh_product_name}} [GatewayClass](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gatewayclass/):

```sh
echo "apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: GatewayClass
metadata:
  name: kuma
spec:
  controllerName: gateways.kuma.io/controller" | kubectl apply -f -
```

At this moment, when you install Gateway API CRDs after installing {{site.mesh_product_name}} control plane you need to restart it to start Gateway API controller. To do this run: 

```sh
kubectl rollout restart deployment {{site.mesh_cp_name}} -n {{ site.mesh_namespace }}
```

## Start a gateway

The [Gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/gateway/) resource represents the proxy instance that handles
traffic for a set of Gateway API routes. You can create gateway with a single listener on port 8080 by running:

```sh
echo "apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: kuma
  namespace: kuma-demo
spec:
  gatewayClassName: kuma
  listeners:
   - name: proxy
     port: 8080
     protocol: HTTP" | kubectl apply -f -
```

{% warning %}
The Kubernetes cluster needs to support `LoadBalancer` for this to work.

If you are running `minikube` you will want to open a [tunnel](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/accessing/#loadbalancer-access) with `minikube tunnel -p mesh-zone`.

You may not have support for `LoadBalancer` if you are running locally with `kind` or `k3d`.
When running `kind` cluster you can try [kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cloud-provider-kind).
{% endwarning %}

You can now check if the gateway is running in the demo app `kuma-demo` namespace:
```sh
kubectl get pods -n kuma-demo
```
Observe the gateway pod:
```sh
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
demo-app-d8d8bdb97-vhgc8   2/2     Running   0          5m
kuma-cfcccf8c7-hlqz5       1/1     Running   0          20s
redis-5484ddcc64-6gbbx     2/2     Running   0          5m
```

Retrieve the public url for the gateway with:
```sh
export PROXY_IP=$(kubectl get svc -n kuma-demo kuma -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')
echo $PROXY_IP
```

Check the gateway is running:
```sh
curl -v ${PROXY_IP}:8080
```

Which outputs:
```sh
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8080...
* Connected to 35.226.116.24 (35.226.116.24) port 8080
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:8080
> User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
> Accept: */*
>
* Request completely sent off
< HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
< content-length: 62
< content-type: text/plain

< server: Kuma Gateway
<
This is a Kuma MeshGateway. No routes match this MeshGateway!
* Connection #0 to host 35.226.116.24 left intact
```
Notice the gateway says that there are no routes configured.

## Define a route using `HTTPRoute`

[HTTPRoute](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/httproute/) resources contain a set of matching criteria for HTTP 
requests and upstream `Services` to route those requests to.
```yaml
echo "apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: echo
  namespace: kuma-demo
spec:
  parentRefs:
    - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
      kind: Gateway
      name: kuma
      namespace: kuma-demo
  rules:
    - backendRefs:
      - kind: Service
        name: demo-app
        port: 5050
        weight: 1
      matches:
        - path:
            type: PathPrefix
            value: /" | kubectl apply -f -
```

Now try to reach gateway again:
```sh
curl -XPOST -v ${PROXY_IP}:8080/api/counter
```

which outputs:
```sh
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8080...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8080
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:8080
> User-Agent: curl/8.4.0
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
< content-length: 19
< content-type: text/plain
< date: Fri, 09 Feb 2024 10:10:16 GMT
< server: Kuma Gateway
< x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 24
<
* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact
RBAC: access denied%
```

Notice the "forbidden" error.
The quickstart applies restrictive default permissions, so the gateway can't access the demo-app service.

To fix this, add a [`MeshTrafficPermission`](/docs/{{ page.release }}/policies/meshtrafficpermission/):

```sh
echo "apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: MeshTrafficPermission
metadata:
  namespace: kuma-demo 
  name: allow-gateway
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: Dataplane
    labels:
      app: demo-app
  from:
    - targetRef:
        kind: MeshSubset
        tags: 
          kuma.io/service: kuma_kuma-demo_svc 
      default:
        action: Allow" | kubectl apply -f -
```

Check it works with:
```sh
curl -XPOST -v ${PROXY_IP}:8080/api/counter
```

Now it returns a 200 OK response:
```sh
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8080...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8080
> POST /api/counter HTTP/1.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:8080
> User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
> Accept: */*
>
* Request completely sent off

* Connection #0 to host 127.0.0.1 left intact
```

## Securing your public endpoint with a certificate

The application is now exposed to a public endpoint thanks to the gateway.
We will now add TLS to our endpoint.

### Create a certificate

Create a self-signed certificate:

```sh
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls.key -out tls.crt -subj "/CN=${PROXY_IP}"
```

Create Kubernetes secret with generated certificate:

```sh
echo "apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-gateway-certificate
  namespace: kuma-demo
type: kubernetes.io/tls
data:
  tls.crt: "$(cat tls.crt | base64)"
  tls.key: "$(cat tls.key | base64)"" | kubectl apply -f - 
```

Now update the gateway to use this certificate:

```sh
echo "apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: kuma
  namespace: kuma-demo
spec:
  gatewayClassName: kuma
  listeners:
    - name: proxy
      port: 8080
      protocol: HTTPS
      tls:
        certificateRefs:
          - name: my-gateway-certificate" | kubectl apply -f -
```

Check the call to the gateway:
```sh
curl -XPOST -v --insecure "https://${PROXY_IP}:8080/api/counter"
```

Which should output a successful call and indicate TLS is being used:
```sh
*   Trying 127.0.0.1:8080...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8080
* ALPN: curl offers h2,http/1.1
