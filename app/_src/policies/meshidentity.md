title: MeshIdentity
---

## Overview

`MeshIdentity` is a resource that defines how workloads in a mesh obtain their cryptographic identity.
It separates the responsibility of issuing identities from establishing trust,
enabling {{site.mesh_product_name}} to adopt [SPIFFE](https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spiffe-about/overview/) compliant practices
while remaining flexible and easy to use.

With `MeshIdentity`, users can:

* Enable secure mTLS between services, using trusted certificate authorities.
* Switch identity providers without downtime, for example when migrating from built-in certificates to [Spire](https://spiffe.io/docs/latest/spire-about/).
* Assign different identity providers to subsets of workloads, allowing more granular control.
* Support multiple trust domains, so workloads in different domains can authenticate each other securely.

A basic example follows to illustrate the structure:

{% policy_yaml %}
{% raw %}
```yaml
type: MeshIdentity
name: identity
mesh: default
spec:
  selector:
    dataplane:
      matchLabels: {}
  spiffeID:
    trustDomain: "{{ .Mesh }}.{{ .Zone }}.mesh.local"
    path: "/ns/{{ .Namespace }}/sa/{{ .ServiceAccount }}"
  provider:
    type: Bundled
    bundled:
      meshTrustCreation: Enabled
      insecureAllowSelfSigned: true
      certificateParameters:
        expiry: 24h
      autogenerate:
        enabled: true
```
{% endraw %}
{% endpolicy_yaml %}

## Configuration

`MeshIdentity` is a namespaced (system-namespace only) resource that controls how data plane proxies receive identity certificates.
It is composed of a few key fields that control how identities are issued and applied.
In the following sections, each field is explained in detail with examples:

* `Selector` – which data plane proxies this identity applies to.
* `SpiffeID` – how the SPIFFE ID is constructed (trust domain and path).
* `Provider` – which system issues the certificates (`Bundled` or `Spire`).

### Selector

The selector field controls which data plane proxies a `MeshIdentity` applies to.
It uses a Kubernetes-style label selector on data plane proxy tags.
This makes it possible to scope an identity to all workloads, a subset of workloads, or none at all.

When multiple `MeshIdentity` resources apply to the same data plane proxy,
the one with the most specific selector (the greatest number of matching labels) takes precedence.

#### Examples

##### Apply to all data plane proxies

```yaml
spec:
  selector:
    dataplane:
      matchLabels: {}
```

##### Apply to a group of data plane proxies

```yaml
spec:
  selector:
    dataplane:
      matchLabels:
        app: my-app
```

##### Apply to nothing

```yaml
spec:
  selector: {}
```

### SpiffeID

The `spiffeID` field lets you override how SPIFFE IDs are constructed for the data plane proxies selected by this `MeshIdentity`.
By default, {{site.mesh_product_name}} generates a SPIFFE ID based on the mesh and zone.
With `spiffeID`, you can customize the `trustDomain` and the `path` template.

{% raw %}
```yaml
spec:
  spiffeID:
    trustDomain: "{{ .Mesh }}.{{ .Zone }}.mesh.local"
    path: "/ns/{{ .Namespace }}/sa/{{ .ServiceAccount }}"
```
{% endraw %}

Supported variables in `trustDomain` field are:
* `.Mesh`
* `.Zone`

Supported variables in `path` field are:
* `.Namespace`
* `.ServiceAccount`

Also, both in `trustDomain` and `path` it's possible to use resource's `labels`, i.e.:

{% raw %}
```yaml
spec:
  spiffeID:
    trustDomain: '{{ label "kuma.io/mesh" }}.{{ label "kuma.io/zone" }}.mesh.local'
    path: '/ns/{{ label "k8s.kuma.io/namespace" }}/sa/{{ label "k8s.kuma.io/service-account" }}'
```
{% endraw %}

### Provider

The `provider` field defines how identity certificates are issued.
This field is required and must specify one of the supported provider types:

* `Bundled` – certificates are issued by {{site.mesh_product_name}}’s control plane, either autogenerated or supplied by the user.
* `Spire` – certificates are issued directly by a SPIRE Agent through SDS.

## Examples

### Minimal `Bundled` MeshIdentity

{% policy_yaml %}
{% raw %}
```yaml
type: MeshIdentity
name: identity
mesh: default
spec:
  selector:
    dataplane:
      matchLabels: {} # apply to all data plane proxies in the mesh
  provider:
    type: Bundled
    bundled:
      meshTrustCreation: Disabled # do not automatically create a MeshTrust from this identity
      insecureAllowSelfSigned: true # explicitly allow use of a self-signed CA
      autogenerate:
        enabled: true # let the control plane autogenerate a CA and store it
```
{% endraw %}
{% endpolicy_yaml %}

### MeshIdentity with CA provided by user

{% policy_yaml %}
{% raw %}
```yaml
type: MeshIdentity
name: identity
mesh: default
spec:
  selector:
    dataplane:
      matchLabels:
        app: my-app # apply to all data plane proxies with label `app: my-app`
  spiffeID:
    trustDomain: "{{ .Mesh }}.{{ .Zone }}.mesh.local"
    path: "/ns/{{ .Namespace }}/sa/{{ .ServiceAccount }}"
  provider:
    type: Bundled
    bundled:
      meshTrustCreation: Enabled # automatically create a MeshTrust from this identity
      insecureAllowSelfSigned: true # explicitly allow use of a self-signed CA
    ca:
      certificate:
        type: File
        file:
          path: /ca.crt
      privateKey:
        type: File
        file:
          path: /ca.key
```
{% endraw %}
{% endpolicy_yaml %}

### MeshIdentity with `Spire` provider

{% policy_yaml %}
{% raw %}
```yaml
type: MeshIdentity
name: identity-spire
mesh: default
spec:
  selector:
    dataplane:
      matchLabels: {}
  spiffeID:
    trustDomain: default.us-east.mesh.local
    path: "/ns/{{ .Namespace }}/sa/{{ .ServiceAccount }}"
  provider:
    type: Spire
    spire: {}
```
{% endraw %}
{% endpolicy_yaml %}
