We’re excited to announce the release of Kuma 2.6, the first release of 2024 packed with exciting changes to help new users.

## Upgrading

We strongly suggest upgrading to Kuma 2.6.0. Upgrading is easy through `kumactl` or Helm.
Be sure to carefully read the [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/UPGRADE.md) before upgrading Kuma.

## Notable features:

* 🚀 `targetRef` policies are now default, newcomers do not need to use or know of older policies anymore.
* 🚀 Standalone mode is getting removed. You can now start a zone without KDS, we also provide an easy path to add a global from an already running zone with *federation*.
* 🚀 You can now apply policies to your zone directly. This helps users to use policies without needing to connect to the global control-plane.
* 🚀 A brand new dataplane GUI which helps you make sense of the dataplane metrics and Envoy configuration.
* 🚀 A `MeshMetric` policy providing the flexibility of `targetRef` policies to your metrics with alpha support for the open telemetry protocol.
* 🚀 `MeshGateway` route now can use `MeshHTTPRoute` and `MeshTCPRoute` and be targeted by policies.
* 🚀 Massive documentation revamp to help users get started and easily find what they need.

And a lot more! Check out the full [release notes](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/releases/tag/2.6.0) to see everything in this release.

## `TargetRef` policies are now default

We've started `TargetRef` policy in order to provide an easy and powerful way to control where and how policies get applied.
After a year of work we are now able to make these as defaults.
This means that new user coming to Kuma will not have to deal with 2 types of policies.

For existing users nothing changes, and they still shouldn't mix and match policies of the same type.
Migrating from old to new policies and deprecating old policies for good is planned for release 2.7.0.

## Bye bye standalone mode

Originally, when starting to use Kuma, you had to make a choice: whether to use a single zone in `standalone` mode or multiple zones in `multi-zone` mode.
This was making day 0 harder and migrating from one to the other was complicated.

We are now deprecating `standalone` mode. Users can start with a single zone and add a global control-plane when they feel the need for it.
We wrote a [guide](https://kuma.io/docs/2.6.x/guides/federate) and tooling to make the migration as easy as possible.

We hope this will make starting with Kuma easier.

If you are using `standalone` mode today, migration to `zone` will be automatic when upgrading.

## Applying policies to your zone

When running with a global control-plane (also known as federated zones), you used to only be able to create, modify and delete policies
on the global control-plane.
This was inconvenient for users mostly using Kubernetes, in 2.6.0 we're lifting this limitation.
Users can now apply policies to their zones and these will be synced to global. They will however, only impact the zones they are applied in.
This provides global visibility through federation while maintaining the security and flexibility of allowing your users to access only one Kubernetes cluster.

## Dataplane GUI

For a long time users have been able to see the XDS config, stats and clusters of their dataplanes running in a zone from the GUI of the global control-plane.
This is powerful but requires pretty deep understanding of Envoy.

We have now provided a new view in the GUI to enable users to make sense of these as you can see in the following screenshots:

## MeshMetric

[`MeshMetric`](https://kuma.io/docs/2.6.x/policies/meshmetric) joins `MeshTrace` and `MeshAccessLog` to complete our `targetRef` based policies for observability.

With this you can easily have different data planes report their metrics differently or elsewhere.

It's as simple as:

```yaml
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: MeshMetric
metadata:
  name: metrics-default
  namespace: kuma-system
  labels:
    kuma.io/mesh: default
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: Mesh
  default:
    backends:
      - type: Prometheus
        prometheus:
          port: 5670
          path: "/metrics"
```

With `MeshMetrics` you can also dynamically reconfigure data plane metrics to get your instances metrics with Kuma labels easily. 
Finally, we also provide alpha support for exporting open telemetry metrics which will enable users to use this open standard for all their telemetry. 

## MeshGatewayRoute deprecation and MeshGateway support for policies

With `MeshHTTPRoute` and `MeshTCPRoute` we make `MeshGatewayRoute` not required anymore.
Users can configure their gateways using these policies and also target `MeshGateway` with its dedicated kind.

For example:

```yaml
---
type: MeshHTTPRoute
mesh: default
name: api-play-000
spec:
  targetRef:
    kind: MeshGateway
    name: edge-gateway
  to:
    - targetRef:
        kind: Mesh
      rules:
        - matches:
            - path:
                type: PathPrefix
                value: /myservice
          default:
            backendRefs:
              - kind: MeshService
                name: my-service_my-namespace_svc_8080
```

This makes the builtin gateway an even simpler and powerful way to get traffic inside your Mesh.

## Documentation revamp

With all these changes to help users get started, we felt it was needed to rebuild some of our docs to make things easier to find.

We now have:

- An opinionated getting started guide that is targeted to the most common use-case: Kubernetes
- A *guides* section with step by step guides to use different features
- A use case based section called *using Kuma* to help users find the feature they are looking for.
- The *policies* section now only contains policies in `targetRef` style but keeps the others in a subsection for reference while they still exist.

As usual we appreciate feedback so let us know what guides you need or what docs needs to be improved in the [issues](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma-website/issues).
